; ruby tunable defaults:
;
;   RUBY_GC_MALLOC_LIMIT=8000000
;       This is the number of C data structures that can be allocated without
;       triggering garbage collection. If this value is too low, then GC may run
;       even if free slots are available.
;   RUBY_HEAP_MIN_SLOTS=10000
;       This is the initial number of heap slots.
;   RUBY_GC_HEAP_FREE_SLOTS=4096
;       If at least this many slots are not free after garbage collection, a new
;       heap will be allocated.
;   RUBY_HEAP_SLOTS_GROWTH_FACTOR=1.8
;       Each time the heap is grown, ruby will add increment*growth_factor
;       slots, where the initial increment is 10,000 slots and each growth count
;       is saved as the new increment. Essentially:
;       increment = (increment || 10000) * growth_factor
